# Pax Amsterdam mod


### Future plans
- Give a bunch of chinese states to european powers, mostly as puppets so that they dont directly have those populations.
    - The dutch get their Canton-Dutch Trade Company a decently sized country in south china
    - Burgundy gets their state in nanking
    - Aquitaine could get shandong
    - Syracuse get a tiny thing
    - Cornwall gets a treaty port
    - Portuguese get something

- India has 3 main powers, bengal, tamil nadu, and central india, with about 40 million each, then around them are smaller european intrusions,
    - Maybe some eurpean puppets, maybe other indian puppets

- Milan is padania an it should start with a really strong economy, alas no colonies because it recently unified

- Anatolia could be split between competing greek states, one of these greek states could have also alexandria

- A stronger arabia (still trash)
    - coming to think of it, maybe just balkanize arabia, since no one is playing it either way, and then since its so split up, its a pain in the ass to conquer so no one really cares

- Powerhouse the economy of the Almohads/Morrocco, maybe even boost their pops

- South east asia could have a strong empire, maybe centered around cambodia
    - capital the city of angkor, maybe make angkor wat a monument
    - give more cambodian pops around the place
    - vietnamese and thai smaller puppet states around it

- give three european powers a foothold in Borneo, that way they kinda wanna expand there but dont start with it.

- South america colonized by portuguese, castillians, almohads mainly
    - maybe a syracuse or greek colony
    - Weird paraguay equivalent
    - Some kind of incan nation, we all love the tawantinsuyu in the other mods, made it really interesting in DoD to have a command economy starter
        - maybe limit this nation to the mountains, with little or no coast
    - Maybe add a US equivalentish in the pampas, ecompassing Grand part of argentina, uruguay and south brasil. High tech economy, not much slavery, mostly european inmigrants, basically a what if argentina went well, and stronger/bigger.
    - Maybe northern brazil amazon colonized by almohads, they would have it easy to bring a LOT of slaves from africa

- Scandia colony completely integrated since it was colonized much before the rest of the europeans came, and had a lot of emigration, maybe a different culture, but larger populations of ex vikings

- US, pd has plans for it

- Almohads prescence in west africa, where they got all the slaves for the colonies
